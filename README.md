## To use

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed
2. At the top of helperfunctions.py, change the parameters k, n, and m to their desired values
3. At the bottom of main.py, uncomment all axioms you want to use
4. Run main.py. It should work for either python2 or python3, but not arbitrarily old versions of 2. Regardless, using python3 should at this point be the default.

## Dependencies

All dependencies installable through pip install

1. tqdm (pip install tqdm)
2. Lingeling (pip install pylgl)
